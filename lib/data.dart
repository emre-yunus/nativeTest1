      text: '''Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing
Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbor
I will run (all around it)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
I'ma make it half the night
Hall light wishes
To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave, your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming
I will run (all around it)
(Sailing off and on, you're on your honor)
Have to crawl
(Carry off and up your seize) still can't
I will run (carry up love along unfettered time)
Now Mona, now Mona
Haven't I locked up my failure (sailing off and ore your odd, your honor)
From the core to the sky
Wouldn't I be last to see? (Carry off and up your seize)
From the door 'til we die
Deny with love my labor (carry up with love a long)
Was it all I could find (we live outside)
Keep waking up high'''

    text: '''Now, look at that road
Look at that climb
When it's throwing in a nickel or get out a dime
Too patterned, too close
Too flattered, too broke
Now look at you go
Took the morning to float
Took the morning to find
I got a vision of a mission but an awkward vibe
Too livid, too scared
Too loving, too closed
Now look at you know
When the cause is on dead arrival
And you coulda shoulda woulda for free
Now look at your post script, every minute
It's a very slow thing to have glean, ah
So maybe you know
Or maybe you don't
It isn't time for a fitting of a passing cloak
Too forward, too fine
Too patient, too wise
Now look at you shine
Took the matter to house
Too the matter to mouth
With the feeling that I'm fishing in a harbor now
Too clever, too kind
Too patterned to hide
Now, look at that smile
So when the 'cause ain't dead on arrival
And you couldn't shouldn't wouldn't for free
Do not hang your cause on revival
'Cause now looking is bringing you grief
So when the cause is dead on arrival
And you coulda shoulda woulda for free
I wouldn't have forced it on the minute
It's a very hard thing to have grief
Ah give it a minute, we're dancing in it''',

    title: 'Nothing Arrived',
    artist: 'Villagers',
    genre: Genre.indiefolk,

    author: 'Conor O''Brien',
    text: '''Savanna scatters and the seabird sings
So why should we fear what travel brings?
What were we hoping to get out of this?
Some kind of momentary bliss?
I waited for something and something died
So I waited for nothing and nothing arrived
It's our dearest ally, it's our closest friend
It's our darkest blackout, it's our final end
My dear sweet nothing, let's start a new
From here all in is just me and you
I waited for something
And something died
So I waited for nothing
And nothing arrived
Well I guess it's over
I guess it's begun
It's a losers' table, but we've already won
It's a funny battle, it's a constant game
I guess I was busy when nothing came
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I waited for something
And something died
So I waited for nothing
And nothing arrived
I waited for something
And something died
So I waited for nothing
And nothing arrived
(Nothing arrived)''',
